# Now comes the juciy part
for number in numbers:  # Loop over numbers array üîÅ
    # using Whatsapp api and webbrowser
    webbrowser.open(
        f'https://api.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+91{number}&text={message}')
    # giving our system time to open chrome
    time.sleep(10) # Increase the time of sleep if your internet or System is slow
    keyboard.press_and_release('enter')


# We are using an api in a way which it was not meant to be used
# we can't just type our message and expect it to work as normal
# message, as the message will be converted to an url and all
# it's rich text will be lost.

# SO! we are going to use URL Encoding Reference to emuilate some
# special charecters.

#### In a nutshell just use %0A before every next line ####

# Here's a list of things you might find usefull

# %03   Enter (carriage return)
# %0A   line feed (Works same as enter)
